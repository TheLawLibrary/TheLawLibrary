### âš¡âš¡ Welcome to the Law Library! âš¡âš¡

**Edit (Aug. 1, 2022):** Shortly after I started bulk uploading files, I ran out of storage space. As a result, the storage of the PDF content has moved to my account at the Internet Archive, which can be found here: [https://archive.org/details/@thelawlibrary](https://archive.org/details/@thelawlibrary). I will continue my usual practice of uploading non-PDF content here. I will also be sure to announce the release of, and provide links to, my itemized content hosted at the Internet Archive.
**//End of Edit//**

Here you will find many repositories containing primary source documents related to all things law. New content is added all the time, so be sure to check back frequently!

**holdings** is the main repository. The README there lays out the reasons for this account's creation and the principles furthered. In the future, the content in the **holdings** repository may be separated out into different repositories so as to help with targeted clones for particular categories of legal texts.

For clarity, I am not a professional programmer. I am a lawyer, though. I am most comfortable when using HTML and CSS. But I want to learn new ways to help automate some of the processes that I now perform by hand to add, find, process, and maintain the site. To that end, I have learned some rudimentary Python and plan to learn more. I also want to learn more about XML and XSLT, and how to turn XML into beautiful PDF documents. I am always open to suggestions and welcome any comments or ideas! 

**This Library is your Library!**
