### âš¡âš¡ Welcome to the Law Library! âš¡âš¡

Here you will find many repositories containing primary source documents related to all things law. New content is added all the time, so be sure to check back frequently! 

"Holdings" is the main repository. The README there lays out the reasons for this account's creation and the principles furthered. In the future, the content in the "Holdings" repository may be separated out into different repositories so as to help with targeted clone requests for particular categories of legal texts.

For clarity, I am not a professional programmer. I am most comfortable when using HTML and CSS. But I want to learn new ways to help automate some of the processes that I now perform by hand to add find, process, and maintain the site. To that end, I have learned some rudimentary Python and plan to learn more. I also want to learn more about XML and XSLT, and how to turn XML into beautiful PDF documents. I am always open to suggestions and welcome any comments or ideas! This Library is your Library!
